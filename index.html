	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<hr class="underline">
	<p class="bodycontent">Hi! I'm Darren Huang. Right now im a student at Wayzata High School on my junior year. I'm really into music and games, as well as computers in general. Music has really changed my life, and it has been a real inspiration for me. While lots of people like to listen to music, I like to dive deeper and learn more about music production and composition. The way songs are made and the instruments they use are really interesting to me. Studying the meaning behind lyrics has also been a fun activity to sort of "pass time". I play multiple instruments, including guitar, piano, and trombone.</p>
	
	<p class="bodycontent">Video games have been a huge part of my life growing up as a kid living in the 2010-2020s. Video games have been a huge source of happiness for me, as it allows me to be able to connect with friends online, and not be restricted to having to be in person. I take games pretty seriously, being in the top 1% of many games, and even top 100 in a few. Games have been a huge impact on my life, both for better and for worse. It's pulled me out of tough times, as well as been a partial cause for some of my lowest lows.</p>

	<p class="bodycontent">Computer Science has been a field that I've been looking into studying in college. It has many fields I find myself interested in, as well as having a decent future insight on careers in computer science catagories. The university that has been at the top of my radar is the University of Arizona. They have been recommended as one of the top schools for many catagories under computer science, and despite the incredibly hot summers, it would be nice to get away from all the snow that we get in Minnesota. The development of AI has been a big concern for me as i look into the future, as AI becomes more advanced. The possibility that AI could replace many jobs in the computer science fields, and even creative fields like design has been a big worry since these are my main interests.</p>
